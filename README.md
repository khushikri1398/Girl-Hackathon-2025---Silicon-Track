## **AI Algorithm for Predicting Combinational Logic Depth in RTL Designs**  
### **Girl Hackathon 2025 - Silicon Track**  

This project aims to **predict combinational logic depth** in **behavioral RTL** (Register Transfer Level) designs using **machine learning (ML)**. By estimating combinational depth early in the design process, this approach helps **identify potential timing violations before synthesis**, reducing design iterations and improving efficiency.

---

## **Why is This Important?**  
**Timing analysis** is a critical step in digital design. However, traditional timing analysis is performed *after synthesis*, which is time-consuming. If a **timing violation** occurs due to excessive **combinational depth**, engineers often need to **refactor the architecture**, further delaying project execution.  

By **predicting combinational logic depth from RTL code itself (before synthesis)**, our **AI model** enables **early detection of potential violations**, helping designers take **proactive corrective actions**.

## **Understanding Combinational Logic Depth**  
- **Combinational Complexity / Logic Depth** ‚Üí The number of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.) required to **compute a signal** from other signals that originate from flip-flop outputs.  
- **Timing Violation** ‚Üí Occurs when the longest **combinational logic path** has a **delay greater than the clock period**, meaning the signal cannot settle before the next clock cycle.  

---

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Generate a Dataset** ‚Üí Create synthetic RTL designs with varying complexities and **label them with combinational depth** from synthesis reports.  
2. **Extract Features** ‚Üí Gather features like **fan-in, gate count, logic type, and interconnections** for ML training.  
3. **Train Machine Learning Models** ‚Üí Use **Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR, and Gradient Boosting** to predict **logic depth**.  
4. **Evaluate Performance** ‚Üí Compare predicted and actual combinational depths using **correlation metrics**.  
5. **Optimize and Deploy** ‚Üí Improve the model and integrate it into **EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools** for real-world usage.

## **Dataset Overview**  
Our dataset consists of **1,000 RTL designs**, each labeled with its **estimated and actual combinational logic depth**.  

### **Features in the Dataset**  
| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **File Path** | Location of the RTL design |
| **Result Signal** | The signal whose combinational depth is analyzed |
| **Estimated Depth** | Predicted combinational depth using heuristics |
| **Actual Depth** | Depth obtained from synthesis reports |
| **Complexity Level** | An indicator of design complexity (1-5) |
| **Design Type** | ALU, pipeline, processor datapath, etc. |

## **Machine Learning Models Used**  
We experimented with the following **ML algorithms** to predict combinational depth:

| Model | Performance |
|-------|------------|
| **Linear Regression** | ‚≠ê **Best performing model** |
| Random Forest | Good performance, but slightly overfitting |
| XGBoost | Competitive, but computationally expensive |
| Support Vector Regression (SVR) | Moderate accuracy |
| Gradient Boosting | Good performance, but slower |

### **Why Linear Regression?**  
‚úÖ **High Correlation (0.9598)** between **estimated and actual depths**  
‚úÖ **Interpretable** ‚Üí Designers can understand how different factors impact combinational depth  
‚úÖ **Computationally Efficient** ‚Üí Works well for large-scale RTL designs
